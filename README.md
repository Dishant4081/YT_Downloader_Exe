**YT Downloader Exe**

Note: If you only want to download videos in 720p & 360p, there is no need to download FFMPEG. You can skip to Step 2.

Follow these steps to run YT Downloader Exe on your Computer/Laptop.

*Step 1:*
If you intend to download a video with a resolution of 1080p and below, you'll need to download FFMPEG.

To download FFMPEG, you can refer to this video: https://youtu.be/vEnSO6wWGGs?si=kVI9dpS62VsBoDUw
If you encounter any issues, you can find more videos on Youtube.

*Step 2:*
Download the repository as a zip file or use git clone to download it to your computer.

*Step 3:*
Extract the downloaded file and ensure that the images remain in the folder.

*Step 4:*
Run the app.exe file.

*Step 5:*
When you run this file, Windows Security might immediately block it. Don't worry. Click on "More options" and then click on "Run anyway."

*Step 6:*
Now your YT Downloader will work perfectly.

***Why does Windows Security block it?
The reason is that I am providing you with an executable file, and this format is not considered a safe way to execute directly on a computer. However, rest assured that it will not harm your computer.***
